The Latin version of the s/w is essentially a demo version I created for the Pi Big Birthday weekend. It is missing a number of the features of the fully English version.

You can set the time and shut the pi down in the same way as the main FT application.
It does not have
-	Any control of brightness – it is always set to full
-	Demo mode
-	Align mode

The following table should help explain the time display, I have no training in Latin, this ws generated based on Google searches !
